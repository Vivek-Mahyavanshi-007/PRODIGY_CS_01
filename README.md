🔒 Exploring Caesar Cipher Encryption &amp; Decryption Algorithm with Prodigy InfoTech 🔍

As Part Of My Cybersecurity Internship At Prodigy InfoTech, I've Been Diving Into The Fundamentals Of Cryptography, Starting With The "Classic Caesar Cipher Algorithm". This Python Program Demonstrates Both { Encryption And Decryption Processes }, Allowing Users To Secure Their Messages With A Simple Shift-Based Substitution Technique.

🛠️ Features:
-- User-Friendly Interface: Designed With Simplicity In Mind, The Program Provides Clear Prompts And Feedback To Guide Users Through The Encryption And Decryption Process.
-- Colorful Output: Utilizing The Colorama Library, The Interface Is Enhanced With Vibrant Colors, Enhancing Readability And User Experience.
-- File Output: Messages, Both Encrypted And Decrypted, Are Saved To A File Named "passwords.txt", Ensuring Data Persistence And Easy Access For Future Reference.

💡 Learning Experience:
Through This Project, I've Gained Hands-On Experience In:
-> Implementing Encryption And Decryption Algorithms In Python.
->Enhancing User Interfaces With Color And Intuitive Design.
-> Managing File Input/Output Operations For Data Storage And Retrieval.

🚀 Next Steps:
As I Continue My Internship Journey At Prodigy InfoTech, I'm Excited To Explore More Advanced Cryptographic Techniques And Their Applications In Real-World Cybersecurity Scenarios. Stay Tuned For Further Updates On My Progress!
